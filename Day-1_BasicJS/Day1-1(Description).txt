Explanation:

The initial console.log() statement simply welcomes us to the script.

We then move on to the introduction of variables. First, we define a 
constant (const) variable emailId, followed by accountId and accountPass 
declared with let and var, respectively. Lastly, fName is declared without 
any keyword, implicitly creating a global variable.

After declaring and initializing the variables, we log their values to 
the console to see what we've stored.

We then attempt to change the values of accountId, accountPass, and fName, 
showcasing how constants and variables declared with let and var behave 
differently when it comes to reassignment.

Finally, we log the updated values to observe the changes.
